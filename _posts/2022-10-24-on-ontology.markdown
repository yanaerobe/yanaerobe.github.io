In classical Copycat, nodes are all the concepts that appear in this domain. But what is a concept? I would say a concept is given by its relationship with other known concepts.

Is this a chicken-egg situation? No. Very basic concepts, e.g., left, right, etc. are given implicitly and very naturally by basic physical phenomena and laws, i.e., Tao(道).

It is a problem though, what are these basic concepts. But transparency dominates here, that for us high-level AI developers we do not care about what they are or what they mean -- *it's written in the seemingly unspeakable, intrinsic essence of the universe*.
