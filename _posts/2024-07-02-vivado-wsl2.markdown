## Background

WSL2 does not support native connection to USB devices on host machine. This blog
briefly introduces steps in sharing and connecting devices via `usbipd` under WSL2.

## Prerequisites

1. WSL2
2. `usbipd` [installation](https://github.com/dorssel/usbipd-win/releases) in Windows.

### USB attachment

In Windows powershell **with admin previledge**, run:

> NOTE: attach **ALL** devices from the board

```powershell
# find USB busid
usbipd list

# share devices with WSL2
usbipd bind --busid $(BUS_ID)

# attach to WSL2
usbipd attach --wsl --busid $(BUS_ID)
```

In WSL2, check attached devices:

```bash
lsusb
```

### Connect in Vivado

Linux Vivado doesn't provide cable drivers by default. Therefore, to install
the drivers, in WSL2 run:

```shell
cd $XILINX_VIVADO/data/xicom/cable_drivers/lin64/install_script/install_drivers
sudo ./install_drivers
```

Then, open Vivado with `sudo` (?), or modify USB device ownership with `usermod`
or `chmod`. e.g.,

```shell
chmod -R -777 /dev/bus/usb
```

As a result of successful executions, one can now connect to the board in Vivado
under WSL2.

### Group policy

On managed PCs, group policies may block `usbipd` from connecting to
Windows. To solve this:

1. Go to `C:/Windows/System32`.
2. Run `gpedit.msc` (group policy editor) as admin.
3. in Computer Configuration > Windows Settings >
Security Settings > Windows Defender with Advanced Security > Windows Defender
Firewall with ... > Inbound rules
4. Add a rule to allow TCP at port 3240 at least for `usbipd`.
5. Rerun `powershell` steps.
