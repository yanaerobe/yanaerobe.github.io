## What I Do

![IntroSlide](/assets/1min_YJY.png){: .w-50 .left}

My project talks about cognitive systems, a combination of both theories and hardware.

Many cognitive models have been proposed over the years, and our main goal is to exploit our advanced **memristor** technology and build a model of our own. With the aid of a database accelerator and a symbolic AI accelerator, the system will be capable of performing a series of tasks.

Such a cognitive system is powerful for multiple usages, including pattern analogies, further on image recognition, UAV control and target search (heated topics in computer vision). And most importantly, explaining and imitating human cognition.
